Your objective is to identify value bets for matches ending in a **Draw (X)**.
**Task Overview:**
1. Identify matches for **TODAY** in the **Primary Target Leagues**.
2. If fewer than 6 matches are found in the Primary list, search the **Backup Leagues** to reach the minimum quota.
3. Analyze factors favoring a low-scoring stalemate.
4. **Learning Phase:** If I provided results from previous predictions at the start of this chat, analyze the wins/losses briefly to adjust your weightings for today's picks.

**Target Leagues:**
 * **Primary:**
 * Iran Persian Gulf Pro League
 * Egypt Premier League
 * Iran Azadegan League
 * Scotland Championship
 * Argentina Primera B / Nacional
 * Italy Serie B
 * Morocco Botola Pro
 
 
 * **Backup (Use only if needed to reach 6 matches):**
 * France Ligue 2
 * Spain Segunda Division
 * South Africa Premier Division (PSL)
 * Greece Super League 2
 
 
 
 
 **Process & Rules:**
 **1. Data Collection:**
 * Use search tools to find all matches scheduled for **today**.
 * **Convert all kick-off times to WAT (West Africa Time).**
 * **Exclude** matches that have already finished or are in the second half.
 * **Niche League Protocol:** If advanced data (xG) is unavailable for a league (e.g., Iran Azadegan), rely on League Table Standings, Home/Away records, and Goals Scored/Conceded averages.
 
 
 **2. Analysis Criteria (Weighted):**
 * **Primary (High Weight):** High League Draw Rate, Low Scoring Expectation (Under 2.5 favored), Form Stalemates (recent draws).
 * **Secondary (Medium Weight):** Motivation (Fear of losing), Missing Top Scorers (Check projected lineups).
 * **External (Low Weight):** Weather (Rain/Wind), Pitch conditions.
 
 
 **3. Selection & Ranking:**
 * **Count:** Select a **minimum of 6** and a **maximum of 10** matches.
 * **Confidence Levels:**
 * **High (35%):** Strong statistical backing + Low goal expectancy.
 * **Medium (30-35%):** Good statistical case, but high variance factors present.
 * **Low (<30%):** Speculative; included only to meet the minimum count of 6.
 
 
 
 
 **4. Output Format:**
 Present the predictions in a Markdown Table:
 | Match (Home vs Away) | League | Time (WAT) | Confidence | Pred. Score | Key Reasoning (Concise) |
 | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 | Team A vs Team B | League Name | 14:00 | High | 1-1 | Avg 0.9 xG; Heavy rain; Top scorer out |
 
 
 *After the table, provide a brief 1-sentence summary of the "Best Bet" of the day.*

**How to use this:**

1. **Copy and paste** the text above into the AI.
2. (Optional) If you have results from yesterday, paste them **before** the prompt saying: *"Yesterday's results: Team A won, Team B drew. Here is today's prompt..."*

Good luck with your predictions!
